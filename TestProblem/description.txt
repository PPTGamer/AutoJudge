Create a program which performs basic arithmetic.

[Input and Output]
Your program will take two positive integers as input (a and b, 0<=a,b<=1000), and output 5 lines, as follows:
The first line is the sum of a and b.
The second line is the value of b subtracted from a.
The third line is the product of a and b.
The fourth line is the quotient when a is divided by b. (not including the remainder)
The fifth line is the remainder when a is divided by b.

Sample Input 1:
55 3

Sample Output 1:
58
52
165
18
1

Sample Input 2:
128 8

Sample Output 2:
136
120
1024
16
0

Explanation for Sample Input and Output 1:
55 divided by 3 is 18 remainder 1, so the last two numbers in the output are 18 and 1.
